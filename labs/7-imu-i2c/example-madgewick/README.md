### madgewick

The directory: `imu/src` has a madgwick implementation to fuse gyro, accel
and mag.  The `madgwick-blake` directory has a version that fuses gyro
and accel.  They give euler angles as well as other location indications.

I didn't have time to figure out how to use this so: great final project!
