## 240lx Labs.

Many more labs TBA:

   - [1-mailboxes](1-mailboxes): using the GPU mailbox interface
     to do fun hacks such as overclocking the pi.
   - [2-dynamic-code-gen](2-dynamic-code-gen/): how 
     to generate executable machine code at runtime and how to 
     use this trick to do neat stuff.  
   - [3-ir](3-ir): simple IR remote control reverse engineering.
   - [4-jit-derive](4-jit-derive): reverse engineer machine code encodings
     using the assembler.
   - [5-malloc+gc](5-malloc+gc): build a Boehm style garbage collector.
   - [6-debug-alloc](6-debug-alloc): build a simple debugging allocator.
     We use this for our later checking tools.
   - [7-imu-i2c](7-imu-i2c): another fun device lab. Write the driver
     for an MPU-6050 accelerometer and gyroscope from the data sheet.
   - [8-i2c](8-i2c): write an I2C driver.  Now all the code for the 
     for the previous MPU lab is yours!
   - [9-profiler](9-profiler): use single-step debug hardware to build
     an exact instruction profiler.  Extend it with sleazy tricks
     to do cycle counting.
