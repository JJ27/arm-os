## 240lx Labs.

This is a partial set of tentative labs.  They've been split into
ones we'll almost certainly do and those that we might do depending
on interest.  In either case, they will change!  Some will get dropped.
Some will get added.  All will get modified significantly.

[2023's repo has a ton of
labs](https://github.com/dddrrreee/cs240lx-23spr/tree/main/labs)
as does [2022](https://github.com/dddrrreee/cs240lx-22spr/tree/main/labs)

if you look through the subdirectories.  It's worth going through these
and letting us know which seem most interesting.

   - There are way more possible labs than class slots so if you can
     please look through these after the first class and see which
     you prefer.

This is the fifth offering of the class.  While we have done many of
the labs once before in cs240lx or cs340lx many ideas are research-paper
level and how to best implement them is still up in the air, so the only
constant will be change.

### 0. Low-level hacking.

The first set of labs are low-level hacking.

   - [1-mailboxes](1-mailboxes): using the GPU mailbox interface
     to do fun hacks such as overclocking the pi.

   - [2-dynamic-code-gen](2-dynamic-code-gen/): how 
     to generate executable machine code at runtime and how to 
     use this trick to do neat stuff.
