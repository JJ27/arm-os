### Prelab for trap based memchecking.

The next couple of labs replicate research papers.  So you should
read them.  The one for today's lab is the original Purify paper:

  - [./docs/cs343-annot-purify.pdf](./docs/cs343-annot-purify.pdf)

You should read it at least a couple of times thoroughly.  Building
it will be a lot easier if you understand it :)
